Open/Closed principle tells us that a software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.
A module is said to be open if it is open for extension.For example, it should be possible to expand its set of operations
or add fields to its data structures.

 A module is said to be closed if it is available for use by other modules.
 This assumes that the module has been given a well-defined and stable description.

 At the implementation level, closure for a module also implies
 that you may compile it, perhaps store it in a library, and make it available for others (its clients) to use.
